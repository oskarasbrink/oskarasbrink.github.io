                        I'm a student in my final year of the Data Science master program att Uppsala University, with a prior BSc in Computer science. I'm currently looking for exjobb/thesis work in the Data Science field starting in January, be it machine learning or Data engineering. My passion is building and implementing in code. I am more of an implementer/doer than a mathematician or scientist, even though my current masters program focuses somewhat more on the latter. I enjoy working in teams and seeing things we build together come to fruition.

                    A role with deliverables mixed in with learning. Main task was further developing and packaging of collected work relating to an AutoGrader for notebooks in Jupyter and Databricks format that will be presented to 
                    Databricks later in the year. Hours for self-study were put into reading further into high-performance Spark. Necessary skills includes Docker-compose, automation of processes using github actions, bash-scripting, refactoring, and general OOP-ification and orgnanizing of an existing project in python.

My main tasks are bugfixes, adding functionalities, rewriting code and refactoring and restructuring the whole project. This is still in early development, and is intended to be easily implemented and scaleable to other courses. This AutoGrader is currently used in two courses at Uppsala University. It is able to fetch student submissions from the learning management system Canvas
                    , add extra cells to the notbook to check student solutions when run, and then grade it locally or on a Databricks cluster depending on the format of the notebook. Then remove the traces of the Testing, convert it back to its original format submit to Canvas with a grade and feedback. This was presented and demonstated to <A HREF = "https://www.databricks.com/university"></A>Databricks University Alliance</h3>  in late september 2022.

                            An AutoGrader for notebooks in JSON-format and Currently supports notebooks in Jupyter and Databricks formats. It fetches assignment from Canvas, converts them to JSON-format, grades them in a Docker envirnonment for Jupyter and on Databricks for dbc notebooks. After sucessful grading the assignments are automatically uploaded to Canvas with its respective grade.
                            My main part in this was combining projects for the handling of the notebooks, autograder and Canvas communication into one package, and refactoring and cleaning/OOP-ification of the whole project. I also continued the development of the system for Databricks notebooks and added some fetures related to them.

                            A Phd-level course in Data Science at Uppsala University, currently held for the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program. I contributed with an implementation of automatic generation of MDBooks, that combines content of databricks notebooks into one large MDBook that previously where generated manually. This was done through github actions and dockerization. I also helped with the setup of the AutoGrader for the course, in databricks format. See the link below for the course information page where the MDBooks are found under "book" in each module.

                            A project developed with friends to use data from Allsvenskan-league to build and train a Machine-Learning model to predict odds. The intention is to use it to predict odds on Lower-level leagues once the model shows good results, using the fact that betting-companies put less efforts in lower-level leagues. 
                            Currently trying out different models, loss functions and ways to standardize football-odds from different betting companies. Code and instructions on how to format your own data is under way to be able to use your own data, since we don't provide our data sources.
